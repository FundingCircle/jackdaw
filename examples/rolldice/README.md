# jackdaw-example

This repo contains a simple example app to demonstrate usage of Jackdaw's Client API (Consumer and Producer API). The app rolls a dice `n` number of times where `n` is provided by the user. A Jackdaw Producer writes the numbers to the input topic `rolldice`. A Jackdaw consumer continuously reads from the topic, adds up the numbers and prints out the result. To exit the consumer loop, press Ctr+c.

## Installation
