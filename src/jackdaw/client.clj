(ns jackdaw.client
  "Clojure wrapper to Kafka's consumer and producer APIs.

  The consumers and producers are the basis for streams, and many
  other use cases. They can be used to send messages directly to, or
  read messages from topics. There are also some facilities for
  polling, and transactions.

  See `jackdaw.client.*` for some add-ons atop this API.
